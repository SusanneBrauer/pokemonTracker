## Purpose
This is a pokedex type tracker for the pokemon games. To keep track of the pokemon you have caught to help you know which ones you still need and to help you plan if you need more than one to swap them with other versions of the same generation of games. For the moment only the first generation games Blue, Red and yellow will be covered.
